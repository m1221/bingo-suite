In no order of priority:
1. make more user-friendly 
	- establish pre-defined formats for card printouts
2. add app for odds calculation
    - this will require a dive into stats
3. add a thorough readme for usage instructions
4. make all scripts callable from anywhere, not just directories of scripts
