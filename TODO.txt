In no order of priority:
1. make more user-friendly 
	- establish pre-defined formats for card printouts
	- make a script that makes cards and pdfs
2. add spreadsheet for odds calculation
3. add code documentation
4. add a thorough readme for usage instructions
5. for Bingo Card Caller:
	i. add Letter+Image mode
		- currently there is just one mode, and it calls just images
    	- e.g. "B-Witch"
	ii. add Number mode
	iii. add Letter+Number mode
6. in ./make-cards.py, load fonts individually
7. add 'help' to ./make-cards (separate from `python ./make-cards -h`)
8. add letter ('BINGO') functionality to Bingo Card Maker
	- currently, all columns share a single pool of numbers (once an image/number has been pulled, it cannot be used in other columns)
	- by default, bingo should have duplicated pools of items for each column
	- give user the option to choose between default bingo and 'single-pool' bingo
